Secure Code Review
1. Introduction
1.1 Overview of Secure Code Review
A secure code review is a vital part of ensuring the security and integrity
of a software system. It involves a detailed examination of the source
code with a focus on identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities that could
be exploited by attackers. This process is crucial in detecting common
security flaws such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), improper
authentication mechanisms, and insecure data storage practices. Security
vulnerabilities can lead to significant risks, including data breaches,
unauthorized access, and application downtime.
In todayâ€™s digital world, where cyber-attacks are increasingly
sophisticated and widespread, ensuring the security of code before it
goes into production is essential. Secure code reviews are typically
performed manually by security experts or using automated tools
designed to identify vulnerabilities based on predefined rules.

2. Code Walkthrough
Below is a simple Flask web application that contains several security vulnerabilities.
This code handles user registration, login, and a user dashboard. We will walk
through the code, examine its functionality, and identify the security flaws in each
section.
import sqlite3
from flask import Flask, request, redirect, render_template, url_for, session
app = Flask(__name__)
app.secret_key = 'secretkey'
# Database connection
def get_db():
conn = sqlite3.connect('users.db')
conn.row_factory = sqlite3.Row
return conn
# User Registration Page
@app.route('/register', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def register():
if request.method == 'POST':
username = request.form['username']
password = request.form['password']
conn = get_db()
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute(f"INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES ('{username}', '{password}')")
conn.commit()
conn.close()
return redirect(url_for('login'))
return render_template('register.html')
# User Login Page
@app.route('/login', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def login():
if request.method == 'POST':
username = request.form['username']
password = request.form['password']
conn = get_db()
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute(f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='{username}' AND password='{password}'")
user = cursor.fetchone()
conn.close()
if user:
session['user_id'] = user['id']
return redirect(url_for('dashboard'))
else:
return 'Invalid credentials', 401
return render_template('login.html')
# User Dashboard
@app.route('/dashboard')
def dashboard():
if 'user_id' not in session:
return redirect(url_for('login'))
return 'Welcome to your dashboard!'
if __name__ == '__main__':
app.run(debug=True)
Code Overview
This code is part of a basic web application built using the Flask framework. The app
has three primary functionalities:
1.User Registration: Users can register by providing a username and password.
2.User Login: Users can log in with their credentials (username and password).
3.Dashboard: After successful login, users are redirected to their dashboard.
However, this simple application contains several vulnerabilities that need to be
addressed for better security.
3. Vulnerabilities and Risks
3.1 SQL Injection
Description of Vulnerability
SQL injection occurs when user input is directly embedded into SQL queries without
proper sanitization. In this application, user input for both username and password
is directly inserted into SQL queries. For example, the register and login routes use
string concatenation to build SQL queries:
cursor.execute(f"INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES ('{username}',
'{password}')")
This practice makes the application vulnerable to SQL injection attacks, where an
attacker could manipulate the SQL query by entering malicious data.
Risk and Impact
SQL injection attacks allow attackers to alter the SQL queries and potentially:
Bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the application.
Retrieve or modify sensitive user data in the database.
Delete or corrupt data in the database, resulting in data loss.
For example, an attacker might input the following for username in the login form:
username = "admin' --"
password = "password"
This input would cause the SQL query to become:
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='admin' --' AND password='password'
The -- sequence comments out the rest of the query, effectively bypassing the
password check.
Solution
To prevent SQL injection, always use parameterized queries or prepared statements,
which ensure that user input is treated as data, not executable code. For example:
cursor.execute("INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES (?, ?)", (username,
password))
By using parameterized queries, the user input is treated as data, making it impossible
for an attacker to manipulate the query structure.
3.2 Storing Plaintext Passwords
Description of Vulnerability
In the registration route, the password is stored as plain text in the database:
cursor.execute(f"INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES ('{username}',
'{password}')")
Storing passwords in plain text is a critical security vulnerability. If the database is
compromised, attackers can easily access all user passwords.
Risk and Impact
Data Breach: If attackers gain access to the database, they can steal all user
passwords.
Account Compromise: Attackers can use the stolen passwords for further attacks,
such as gaining access to other accounts or performing brute-force attacks.
Solution
Passwords should never be stored in plain text. Instead, use a secure cryptographic
hash function to hash the password before storing it in the database. One widely used
library for secure password hashing is bcrypt:
from werkzeug.security import generate_password_hash, check_password_hash
# Hash the password before storing it
hashed_password = generate_password_hash(password)
cursor.execute("INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES (?, ?)", (username,
hashed_password))
# Check the hashed password during login
if check_password_hash(user['password'], password):
 # Login successful
This ensures that even if the database is compromised, attackers cannot easily recover
the original passwords.
3.3 Lack of Input Validation
Description of Vulnerability
The application does not validate or sanitize user inputs, such as the username
and password fields. Malicious users could enter any kind of input, including
scripts or overly long strings, which might cause unexpected behavior or even
security risks such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
Risk and Impact
XSS Attacks: If input is not sanitized before being rendered in the browser,
attackers could inject malicious JavaScript, leading to XSS attacks.
Application Crashes: Unchecked user inputs could also cause the
application to crash or behave unpredictably.
Solution
All user inputs should be validated and sanitized to ensure that they are both
expected and safe. For example, you can enforce rules for username (only
alphanumeric characters) and password (minimum length). You can use regular
expressions for validation:
import re
# Validate username
if not re.match("^[A-Za-z0-9]+$", username):
 return 'Invalid username', 400
Additionally, user inputs should be sanitized before being rendered in the
browser to prevent XSS.
3.4 Weak Session Management
Description of Vulnerability
The application uses a static secret_key for managing sessions:
app.secret_key = 'secretkey'
Using a static or weak session key makes the application vulnerable to session
hijacking or fixation attacks. If an attacker can guess or brute-force the session
key, they could manipulate the session data, impersonating other users.
Risk and Impact
Session Hijacking: Attackers can steal or impersonate valid sessions,
gaining unauthorized access to sensitive areas of the application.
Privilege Escalation: Attackers might escalate privileges or gain full control
of the application.
Solution
To mitigate this risk, always use a strong, randomly generated session secret
key. For example:
import os
app.secret_key = os.urandom(24) # Use a securely generated random key
3.5 Lack of HTTPS
Description of Vulnerability
The application does not enforce HTTPS, which means that all data, including
sensitive information like passwords, is sent in plaintext over the network. This
makes the application vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.
Risk and Impact
MitM Attacks: Attackers on the same network can intercept and read
sensitive information, including passwords and session cookies.
Data Tampering: Attackers can alter the data being transmitted between
the client and server, potentially compromising the integrity of the
application.
Solution
To prevent MitM attacks, always enforce HTTPS for all communication
between the client and server. In a production environment, this can be
accomplished by configuring an SSL/TLS certificate:
app.config['PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME'] = 'https'
Additionally, ensure that your web server (e.g., Nginx or Apache) is configured
to use SSL certificates.
4. Conclusion
This secure code review has identified several critical vulnerabilities in the
sample code, including SQL injection, storing plaintext passwords, lack of input
validation, weak session management, and the absence of HTTPS. Each of
these vulnerabilities exposes the application to various attack vectors,
including unauthorized access, data breaches, session hijacking, and Man-inthe-Middle attacks.
To mitigate these risks, we recommended a series of security improvements,
including:
Using parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
Storing hashed passwords using strong cryptographic algorithms.
Validating and sanitizing all user inputs.
Using a strong, randomly generated session secret key.
Enforcing HTTPS to ensure secure communication.
By applying these secure coding practices and following security best
practices, developers can significantly improve the security of their
applications and reduce the risk of cyberattacks.
Regular code reviews, automated security testing, and keeping up with the
latest security trends and vulnerabilities are essential for maintaining secure
software and protecting user data.
